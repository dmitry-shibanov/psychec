# PsycheC

PsycheC is a compiler frontend infrastructure for the C language that is enabled with an ML/Haskell-style (unification-based) type inference engine.
[This online interface](http://cuda.dcc.ufmg.br/psyche-c/) illustrates the essential functionality of PsycheC.

Applications:

- Compiling a code snippet (e.g., retrieved from a bug tracker) without a build environment.
- Statically analysing a partial program, by isolating uninteresting dependencies.
- Enabling static analysis tools upon `#include` failures - common in cross-platform/embedded development.
- Generating test-input data for functions in an independent manner.
- Quick prototyping of an algorithm without the definition of concrete types.

Be creative!

## Requirements

To *build* PsycheC:

* Cmake
* C++14 compiler
* Haskell Stack

To *use* PsycheC (download [here](http://www.cnippet.cc/)):

* Python 3

## Building

    cmake CMakeLists.txt  
    make

## Running the Tests

    ./psychecgen -t
    ./test_infer_and_compile.sh
    cd solver && stack test && cd -
    cd formalism && ./test_muC.sh

## Using

The simplest way to use PsycheC is through the [Cnippet](http://www.cnippet.cc) compiler adaptor.
Let us see an example.

Consider the file *node.c* below.

```c
// node.c
void f()
{
    T v = 0;
    v->value = 42;
    v->next = v;
}
```

If you were to compile *node.c* with GCC/Clang, you would issue a command similar to this one:

    gcc -c node.c

As a result, an object file *node.o* would have been produced.
However, this will not happen, since a declaration for `T` is not available.
Instead, you will get an "undeclared identifier" error.

Now, if you invoke Cnippet, the compilation succeeds (flag `-f` is for non-commercial use).

    ./cnip.sh -f gcc -c node.c

That is because, under the hood, PsycheC will infer the necessary missing definitions.

```c
typedef struct TYPE_1__
{
    int value;
    struct TYPE_1__* next;
}* T;
```

### Generic Programming

*This is a work-in-progress, feedback is welcome through [this form](https://forms.gle/oJj1YEhAk3jwvHRo8).*

PsycheC provides an alternative to `void*` and `#macros` for writing generic code in C.
This is how you would implement a generic linked-list's `prepend` function.

```c
_Generic void prepend(_Forall(node_t)** head,
                      _Forall(value_t) value)
{
    node_t* n = malloc(sizeof(node_t));
    n->value = value;
    n->next = *head;
    *head = n;
}
```

It is not necessary to define neither `node_t` nor `value_t`.
The definition of `prepend` applies "for all" kinds of nodes and values.
This way, you can focus on the *algorithms* (the essence of generic programming).

Let us create 2 lists, one of `int` and another of `point_t`, and insert an new head to them.

```c
int main()
{
    _Exists(node_t)* ilst = 0;
    prepend(&ilst, 42);

    _Exists(node_t)* plst = 0;
    struct point_t p;
    p.x = p.y = 42;
    prepend(&plst, p);
}

```

Now, PsycheC infers that there "exists" a (node) type whose value is an `int`,
together with an specialization of `prepend` for such arguments.
A different (node) type for `point_t` "exists" too, with its corresponding specialization of `prepend`.
